Rack Javascript Minifiert
=========

A simple middleware that will intercept any request for javascript files, minify 
them and return them. 

This was developed as an example of implementing a rack middleware. Even though 
tested (check specs) it is not intended for production.

Check example for usage guide. You can run it with thin: 

    thin start -R config.ru
